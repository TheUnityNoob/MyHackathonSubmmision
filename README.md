# MyHackathonSubmmision
My Hackathon Submmision is on a game I made called "Ragdoll Rush". The environment is based on a hot summer island (I used the theme). The point of the game is to escape the island before the time runs out. Reach the plane before its to late. To make this game I had to code active ragdolls. The hardest part was blending physics with animation. I used the Unity Game Engine and used C#.
